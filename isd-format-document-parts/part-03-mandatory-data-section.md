Bold type below indicates that the element may include data originating from NCEI’s NCEI SURFACE
HOURLY/ASOS/AWOS or from AFCCC’s USAF SURFACE HOURLY. Otherwise, data originated from USAF SURFACE
HOURLY.

Note: For the quality code fields with each data element, the following may appear in data which were processed through
NCEI’s Interactive QC system (manual interaction), for selected parameters:
    A – Data value flagged as suspect, but accepted as good value.
    U – Data value replaced with edited value.
    P – Data value not originally flagged as suspect, but replaced by validator.
    I – Data value not originally in data, but inserted by validator.
    M – Manual change made to value based on information provided by NWS or FAA.
    C – Temperature and dew point received from Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS) are reported in
    whole degrees Celsius. Automated QC flags these values, but they are accepted as valid.
    R – Data value replaced with value computed by NCEI software.
